First off: this library was originally started as a way to teach 5th and 6th graders at a local elementary school to program in C for an inner-school robotics competition. These students will be given a TI launchpad, breadboard, photo diodes, motors (with enough hardware already soldered on to do one-way motor control), and a "magician" chaise that screws together easily. Students will be on teams of three or four.

Now, about the game: This year's game is a form of capture the flag in which student's robots will have to find the "flag", which will be weighted and have ~6 white LEDs facing outward, in a darkened room using the photo diodes. There will be a field which will only be a wooden frame (the exact dimensions have not been decided yet). The competition will be made up one-on-one one-minute rounds and will be double elimination.
