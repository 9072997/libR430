title: Launchpad Rev1.5 Support
---
We have added support for the rev1.5 launchpad. A new branch has bean created for the old rev1.4 code which will hopefully be merged via a use of compiler if-defs to distinguish between the chips. Next Tuesday the kids stard programing, so I pray all the kinks are relitively worked out, but I am thankfull to God that we got this far. Good luck to all the teams!
